# Project 3 - Software Architecture Design 
Welcome to the final project of the course! Breathe a sigh of relief because we are not working with Music for this project, or any existing repository for that matter.  
The goal of this project is to put to use what you've learnt about software architecture. For this, you will design the architecture of a system according to the specified requirements. You are free to use any language or framework.  
You are required to choose **one** of the following two systems - 
- [Project A - CineStream Platform](/cs6401_se_2023/Projects/project-3/OTT)
- [Project B - Smart City System](/cs6401_se_2023/Projects/project-3/IOT) 

## Submission 
We will use GitHub classrooms for this project. Follow [this](https://classroom.github.com/a/oaTypZ7Q) link to accept the assignment. 
In addition to the required code, submit a report containing your responses to the different tasks titled ```project3_<team_number>.pdf``` 

Soft deadline - 26th April, 2023   
Hard deadline - 3rd May, 2023  

Note that the deadlines cannot be extended as we are constrained by the endsems and grade submission deadline.
